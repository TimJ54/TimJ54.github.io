<h3>What we do</h3>
	<p>&#9830; MobileShop fixes electronic devices (it’s in our name after all). From the classic phone drop in the parking lot to the tablet in the toilet. We’ve seen it all. We understand how traumatic it is when you break your favorite devices and we want you to feel better the moment you walk in.</p>

<h3>What We Offer Our Guest</h3>
	<p>&#9830; The MobileShop Repair Store and many of our Apple Authorized Service Providers offer same-day service for some repairs, such as screen repair. If your technician needs to send your iPhone to an Apple Repair Center, you'll be notified when it's ready for pickup.</p>
	
<h3>No matter the iPhone model, we can fix it..</h3>
	<p>&#9830; Every iPhone Repair starts with a free diagnostic exam to determine what is causing the issues plaguing your iPhone. Our comprehensive diagnostic service helps us identify the problem and decide which of our repair services will best fix it. From there, repairs can begin in-store right away and usually take about an hour.</p>
